The following plugins will be used in the course, and are easily installable through the Plugins tool in QGIS.

### **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP)**

The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin is a QGIS plugin for supervised classification of remote-sensing images, designed to simplify workflows for satellite image preprocessing, training data collection, and land-cover classification.  
It supports Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, and other imagery, and includes tools for band combinations, atmospheric correction etc, within QGIS.

How to install:
1. Open QGIS.
    
2. Go to Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins...
    
3. In the Plugins window, type *“Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin”* in the search bar.
    
4. Click on it, then select Install Plugin.
    
5. Once installed, you may restart QGIS. Alternatively, install the Dzetsaka plugin before resterting QGIS.
    

You should now see a **SCP toolbar** and a new **SCP dock** panel (usually on the left side of the interface).

### **Dzetsaka Classification Plugin**

Dzetsaka is a lightweight QGIS plugin for machine-learning-based image classification, allowing users to quickly classify raster images using algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and K-Means.  
It integrates directly with the QGIS Processing Toolbox and is ideal for fast, easy land-cover mapping without complex setup.

How to install:
1. Open QGIS.
    
2. Go to Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins...
    
3. In the search bar, type *“Dzetsaka”*.
    
4. Click on Dzetsaka: Classification tool, then click Install Plugin.
    
5. After installation, restart QGIS.
    

You’ll now see **Dzetsaka** in the Processing Toolbox (under “Dzetsaka”) and also in the Plugins menu.
