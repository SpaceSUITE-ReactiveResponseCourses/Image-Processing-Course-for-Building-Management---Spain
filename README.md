# Image-Processing-Course-for-Building-Management---Spain

For the upcoming hand-on courses, the following need to be pre-installed in your computer.

It is important to have these installed before the courses.

1. QGIS
   - For this course we will work wth QGIS 3.28 'Firenze' LTR(Long Term Release). This is a few versions behind the latest version, but because of the compatibility of the plugins we will use, this version is ideal for the course.
   - You can find the installation guide for this here: [QGIS installation](https://github.com/SpaceSUITE-ReactiveResponseCourses/Image-Processing-Course-for-Building-Management---Spain/blob/main/installation%20guides/QGIS%20installation.md)
   -  We will install the plugins together in the session.
  
2. Miniconda
   - Miniconda is a python environment manager and is necessary to run the python code on your computer.
   - You can find the installation guide here: [Miniconda](https://github.com/SpaceSUITE-ReactiveResponseCourses/Image-Processing-Course-for-Building-Management---Spain/blob/main/installation%20guides/Miniconda%20installation.md)
  
     2.1. Conda environment (## DO NOT INSTALL THIS YET! CURRENTLY FIXING!!)
     - Next step is to install the conda environment we will use to run our python application.
     - You can find the installation guide here: [Conda environment](https://github.com/SpaceSUITE-ReactiveResponseCourses/Image-Processing-Course-for-Building-Management---Spain/blob/main/installation%20guides/python-environment.md)
  
3. Google Earth engine
   - You need to have a google earth engine account, which is tied to your google account. Here, you can already register a 'project', as these credentials will be necessary for some of our exercises.
   -  You can find the instructions to do this here: [GEE](https://github.com/SpaceSUITE-ReactiveResponseCourses/Image-Processing-Course-for-Building-Management---Spain/blob/main/installation%20guides/google_earth_engine.md)
  
4. Copernicus account
   - You need to have login credentials to download satellite data in the exercises.
   - You can find the instructions to do this here: [Copernicus](https://github.com/SpaceSUITE-ReactiveResponseCourses/Image-Processing-Course-for-Building-Management---Spain/blob/main/installation%20guides/corpenicus%20login.md)
   - **NOTE**: If you have login credentials to the EU Portal, these will work as well.

Please contact us if you encounter a problem or need some assistance.
